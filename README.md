This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# TO DO List
## Overview
The Goal List App is a mobile application built using JSX with React Native. It provides users with a simple interface to add goals as a list, and upon clicking, the goal is removed from the list. This app aims to help users organize their goals efficiently and track their progress effectively.

## Features
Goal Management: Users can add goals to the list.
Interactive Interface: Goals are displayed as a list, and users can click on each goal to delete it from the list.
React Native Framework: The app is developed using JSX with React Native, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience.

## Usage 
* Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```
* Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Requirements
Node.js
React Native
npm or Yarn package manager

## Feature Enhancement
1. Implementing user authentication to allow users to save their goals and access them across multiple devices.
2. Adding the ability to categorize goals and filter them based on categories.
3. Introducing notifications or reminders to help users stay on track with their goals.
4. Enhancing the user interface with animations and transitions for a more engaging experience.
